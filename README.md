# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

I: 
- Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
